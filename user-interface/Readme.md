User Interface
==============

The current implementation offers both a CLI and a GUI interface.

To use CLI, simply start the *org.kie.interactivepredictions.user.itf.Main* class.

To start the GUI, issue 

    `mvn clean javafx:run`

from `user-interface` directory

To start the GUI in debug mode, issue

    `mvn clean javafx:run@debug`

from `user-interface` directory, and then attach a remote-debug to port 8000
